R code, data files, and manuscript materials from 2020 publication in Marine Biology.

This repository contains the R code needed to replicate the analysis and recreate the figures from my 2021 article in the journal PLOS ONE.

There is a single .csv file needed to import the data into the R environment using the R script.

The manuscript and supplement are also provided as the final product from the analysis. The two word documents include supplemental figures and tables.
